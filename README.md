# Angular Hybrid

This project is referred from [AngularJS Phonecat tutorial project](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat)
converted to a Angular CLI project and hybrid bootstrapped with Angular 4.x.

It started out as a regular Angular CLI project created with

    $ ng new angular-hybrid
    
After that the `app` catalogue from the [AngularJS Phonecat tutorial project](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat)
was copied into the `src/app-ajs` catalogue of this project and `bower_components` was removed.

Then all changes needed to make that demo work as a hybrid was done. 

The main branch is a working hybrid demo application that can be run with

    $ npm start
